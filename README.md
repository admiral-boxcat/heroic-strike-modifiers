# Destiny 2 - Daily Heroic Strike Modifiers Page

A very simple page available at [https://admiral-boxcat.github.io/heroic-strike-modifiers/](https://admiral-boxcat.github.io/heroic-strike-modifiers/) that shows what [Destiny 2](https://www.destinythegame.com/)'s current heroic strike modifiers are, and a preview of what the next will be.

Inspired by [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8n1tww/predictive_heroic_strike_modifiers_through_feb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8n1tww/predictive_heroic_strike_modifiers_through_feb/), I wanted a page that would state what the currently active modifiers are, avoiding the need for me to use my mouse scroll wheel to find today's date on a spreadsheet, or do basic addition to figure out if it's past 9AM Pacific Time.
